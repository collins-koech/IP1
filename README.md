Welcome to my first Website


**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This project was my first website. I learnt a bit about html using div, nav, image and link tags. I also created a css file and picked out tags using classes and direct names and stylised my html to make it look nicer. I then learnt how to use the terminal and then how to use git, so I could backup files to github and keep track of changes, etc.
